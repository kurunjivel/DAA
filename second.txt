### Uses of Git:
- **Team Collaboration**: Helps teams of developers work together on the same codebase without conflicts.
- **Code Management**: Organizes and maintains code efficiently, ensuring that different versions of the project are tracked.
- **Experimentation**: Developers can create branches to test new features or ideas without affecting the main project.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Git integrates well with various CI/CD pipelines, automating the testing and deployment of code.

In short, Git helps developers manage and collaborate on code more effectively. Popular platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket host Git repositories for easier sharing and collaboration.
